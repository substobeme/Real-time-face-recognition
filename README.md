# Real Time Face Recognizer Project

• The project deals with detecting and recognizing faces of registered users in real-time from video feed, and once
recognized, updates in a database(MySQL) with the date and time the user was detected.Flask is also used to create a webapp 
to display the data stored in the database.

• This project employs a LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) model to perform the facial recognition.

• This project can be used to provide effective real-time face recognition for security applications by accurately tracking
and logging individuals.

## Video Feed
Here is a demonstration of the recognizition process.
